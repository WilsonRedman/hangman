# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

To run, execute the hangman.py file in the hangman directory.

All milestone files contain the milestones for the AiCore course, containing early work for different hangman components. These files are not required to run the hangman application.
